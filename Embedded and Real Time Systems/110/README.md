# DESIGN & OPTIMIZATION OF EMBEDDED & REAL-TIME SYSTEMS
 This course had a different format compared to the others.  We were given a working framework based on Quantum Platform, an RTOS with Hierarchical State Machine functionality.  For each assignment, we'd make a backup of the whole project and modify the code to accomplish the task.  Complete Code contains the resulting project at the end of the class; each folder in Complete Code/src is a state machine running on its own thread.

For clarity, I've separated out some interesting HSMs I built during this course.  Traffic Light is, in my opinion, the most interesting structured assignment; focusing on designing the structure of an HSM.  Flight Sim is the Capstone Project, built to use the gyroscope and LCD screen.
